                        <p>Ethereum mining pool & yield farming for miners is the next core feature of DYP for the token to achieve long-term profitability.</p>
                        <p>DYP Ethereum Miner Address <a target='_blank' style={{textTransform: 'lowercase'}} href='https://ethminer.dyp.finance'>ethminer.dyp.finance</a></p>
                        <p>What is this? This is our Ethereum Miner address. The DYP team has been mining Ethereum since 2017, and now we are ready to help the Ethereum Mining Community with our Ethereum mining pool combined with yield farming. We invested more than $1 million dollars in our Mining Farm, so you can be sure that we understand the community’s needs.</p>
                        <p>Every Ethereum Miner address that interacts with our smart contract will get a 10% monthly bonus of the ETH monthly income earned. Let's say ETH price is $1000, DYP price is $5, and your monthly estimated earnings is 1 ETH — that means you will get a monthly bonus of 20 DYP tokens worth $100. This does not stop here; in order to claim your monthly DYP tokens, you will first need to join our Ethereum mining pool with 0% fees, meaning you will also earn more ETH monthly!</p>
                        <p className='m-0'>Ethereum mining pool & yield farming for miners will provide a 10% monthly DYP bonus + 0% mining fees to all Ethereum miners. The Ethereum mining pool will be launched as soon as we get the Hashrate required to mine a pool; currently we have 35 GH/s Hashrate from our miners, the required Hashrate is 250 GH/s.</p>
                        <p><small>Mining pool bonuses will disburse a maximum amount of DYP with a -2.5% Price Impact.</small></p>
