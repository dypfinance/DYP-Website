                                        <p>DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) will provide a solution to the risk Yield Farming brought in. How? – The DYP is developing a platform that allows anyone to provide liquidity and to be rewarded for the first time with Ethereum. At the same time, the platform maintains both token price stability as well as secure and simplified DeFi for end users by integrating a DYP anti-manipulation feature.</p>
                                        <p>How will this work?</p>
                                        <p>DeFi Yield protocol (DYP) is changing the way you earn through liquidity on Ethereum smart contract. The argument against DeFi is that whales have the power to control the network. The Sushi dump is the most remarkable example, there was a flash crash in the tokens when anonymous founder Chef Nomi swapped his Sushi tokens for Ethereum. DeFi Yield protocol (DYP) prevents the whale advantage in DeFi. DYP anti-manipulation feature ensures that all pool (DYP/ETH, DYP/USDC, DYP/USDT, and DYP/WBTC POOL) rewards are automatically converted from DYP to ETH at 00:00 UTC, and the system automatically distributes the rewards to the liquidity providers. This feature is excellent because the network’s liquidity will be fair to all participants; no whale will be able to manipulate the price of DYP to their advantage.</p>
