                                            <p className='pb-0 mb-0'>DeFi Yield Protocol is a decentralized platform that people can use for yield farming, staking, and enabling users to leverage the advanced trading tools of the DYP. Your use of the DeFi Yield Protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited to, losses while digital assets are being supplied to the Uniswap / PancakeSwap / Pangolin protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a liquidity pool. Before using the DeFi Yield Protocol, you should review the relevant documentation from our Github to make sure you understand how the protocol works.
                                                The DeFi Yield Protocol project is public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche Network.</p>
                                            <p className='pt-0 mt-0'>Additionally, just as you can access email protocols such as SMTP through multiple email clients, you can access the DeFi Yield Protocol through dozens of web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees and risks they present.</p>
